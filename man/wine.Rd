\description{
The datasets contains red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced
(e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used
to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant.
}
\details{
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables
are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
