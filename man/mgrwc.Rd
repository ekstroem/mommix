\title{Gaussian mixture of regression models with contamination}
\usage{
mgrwc(y, X, weight, maxit = 400L, tol = 1e-07)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A vector of outcomes.}

\item{X}{A design matrix of regressor variables. Must have the same number of rows as the length of y.}

\item{weight}{A vector of weights for each observation that are used in the estimation.}

\item{maxit}{the maximum number of iterations to use for the EM algorithm}

\item{tol}{the tolerance used for determining convergence}
}
\value{
A list with the variables: N, K, coefficients, mu, sigma1, sigma2, alpha, iterationsused, and groupprob which contains
}
\description{
Fast computation of simple regression slopes for each predictor represented by a column in a matrix
}
\details{
Missing values (NA, Inf, NaN) are completely disregarded and pairwise complete cases are used for the analysis.
}
\examples{
x <- rnorm(1000)
y <- rnorm(1000, mean=c(x[1:700], rep(0, 300)), sd=rep(c(1,2), times=c(700,300)))
mgrwc(y, cbind(rep(1, 1000), x), weight=rep(1, 1000))
